# ResMHCNN
We propose a novel residual multi-head convolution with channel attention block (ResMHCNN) for lightweight network development. We developed BT-Net for brain tumor detection, BC-Net for breast cancer detection and LCC-Net for lung and colon cancer detection. For brain tumor (BT), we used a dataset from Figshare, for lung and colon cancer (LCC), we utilized LC25000 dataset and for breast cancer (BC) we employed BreaKHis dataset. 


The structure of the ResMHCNN block is given below.
